# Overcast: Mark as Played

This is a browser extension (using [the WebExtension API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)) that adds a simple "Mark as Played" button to [the Overcast.fm](https://overcast.fm) user interface.

Please note that this extension is in no way affiliated with [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) or its [owner](https://marco.org/); I'm simply a fan of (and premium subscriber to) the platform.
